You are absolutely right. My apologies\! The previous `README.md` was incorrect because it didn't reflect the two-folder setup we decided on. It was still based on the old single-source structure.

Let's create the correct and final `README.md` for your repository. This version explains the two-folder structure and how to use build arguments to create the separate Docker images for comparison.

# DTPAYNT Search Algorithm Extension

This project contains a modified version of the DTPAYNT tool, originally provided as a supplement to the CAV'25 paper, "Small Decision Trees for MDPs with Deductive Synthesis".

This repository is structured to manage two versions of the algorithm:

1.  **The original Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.**
2.  **Our modified Best-First Search (BFS) algorithm using a priority queue.**

This README provides a complete guide to building the Docker environment for both versions, understanding our algorithmic improvements, and running experiments.

-----

## 1\. Setup and Build Instructions

Follow these steps to build the Docker containers for both the original and modified algorithms.

### Prerequisites

  * **Docker**: Must be installed on your system.
  * **This Git Repository**: You should have this repository cloned to your local machine.

### Folder Structure

This repository uses a two-folder approach to manage the different code versions. The `Dockerfile` is configured to build from either folder using a build argument. The structure is:

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── synthesis-original/     <-- Contains the original DFS code
└── synthesis-modified/     <-- Contains our new Best-First Search code
```

### Build the Docker Images

You will build two separate Docker images, one for each version of the algorithm.

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.

2.  Navigate to the root directory of this repository (the one containing the `Dockerfile`).

3.  **Build the image for the original algorithm**:

    ```bash
    docker build --build-arg SRC_FOLDER=synthesis-original -t dtpaynt-original .
    ```

4.  **Build the image for our modified algorithm**:

    ```bash
    docker build --build-arg SRC_FOLDER=synthesis-modified -t dtpaynt-dev .
    ```

After these commands complete, you will have two Docker images ready for comparison: `dtpaynt-original` and `dtpaynt-dev`.

## 2\. Our Modifications: A Smarter Search Strategy

We have modified the core search strategy of the DTPAYNT algorithm to improve how it explores potential solutions.

  * **Original Algorithm (`dtpaynt-original`)**: The original implementation uses a **stack** to process families of solutions. This results in a **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, where the algorithm explores one branch of the search space as deeply as possible before backtracking.

  * **Our Improvement (`dtpaynt-dev`)**: We replaced the stack with a **priority queue**. This changes the strategy to a **Best-First Search**. The algorithm now uses its internal scoring heuristic (related to the "harmonizing value") to decide which family of solutions is the most promising to explore next. This has the potential to find optimal solutions more quickly.

-----

## 3\. Results Layout at a Glance

All experiment artefacts now live under a single `results/` directory so you can compare runs without hunting across multiple folders:

```
results/
  logs/
    original/   # PAYNT logs produced by the original stack-based solver
    modified/   # PAYNT logs produced by the priority-queue solver
  analysis/     # Tables and plots generated by process_results.py
  subsets/      # Raw outputs from experiments.sh (smoke tests, model subsets)
  archive/      # Legacy runs you want to keep but ignore for comparisons
```

`process_results.py` reads from `results/logs` by default and writes the aggregated CSVs/plots to `results/analysis`.

## 4\. How to Run Experiments for Comparison

Once both images are built, you can run experiments and bind-mount the correct subfolder from `results/`.

### Quick Smoke Test (sanity check)

```bash
# Original DFS solver
docker run -v="$(pwd)/results/subsets/original":/opt/cav25-experiments/results -it dtpaynt-original \
  ./experiments.sh --smoke-test --skip-omdt

# Modified priority-queue solver
docker run -v="$(pwd)/results/subsets/modified":/opt/cav25-experiments/results -it dtpaynt-dev \
  ./experiments.sh --smoke-test --skip-omdt
```

Both commands should finish with `Smoke test passed!`.

### Model Subset (13 benchmarks)

```bash
docker run -v="$(pwd)/results/subsets/original":/opt/cav25-experiments/results -it dtpaynt-original \
  ./experiments.sh --skip-omdt --model-subset

docker run -v="$(pwd)/results/subsets/modified":/opt/cav25-experiments/results -it dtpaynt-dev \
  ./experiments.sh --skip-omdt --model-subset
```

### Optional: with Gurobi (OMDT comparison)

```bash
docker run \
  -v=/absolute/path/to/your/gurobi.lic:/opt/gurobi/gurobi.lic:ro \
  -v="$(pwd)/results/subsets/modified":/opt/cav25-experiments/results \
  -it dtpaynt-dev ./experiments.sh --smoke-test
```

Swap `dtpaynt-dev` for `dtpaynt-original` if you need the stack-based solver instead.

## 5\. Structured Logging Runs (One-Liners)

The Click-based runner writes a `progress.csv`, `stdout.txt`, and `run-info.json` per benchmark. Mount `results/logs/<algorithm>` into the container to collect them:

```bash
# Original solver, default presets (csma-3-4, consensus-4-2, obstacles)
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/results/logs/original":/results \
  dtpaynt-original \
  bash -lc "cd /opt/synthesis-original && python3 experiments-dts.py \
    --benchmark csma-3-4 --benchmark consensus-4-2 --benchmark obstacles \
    --timeout 600 --output-root /results"

# Modified solver, same presets
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/results/logs/modified":/results \
  dtpaynt-dev \
  bash -lc "cd /opt/synthesis-modified && python3 experiments-dts.py \
    --benchmark csma-3-4 --benchmark consensus-4-2 --benchmark obstacles \
    --timeout 600 --output-root /results"
```

Each run folder looks like `results/logs/original/csma-3-4/<timestamp>/`.

### Optional: Force Larger Trees

Use the built-in preset `csma-3-4-depth3` to exercise deeper trees:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/results/logs/original":/results \
  dtpaynt-original \
  bash -lc "cd /opt/synthesis-original && python3 experiments-dts.py \
    --benchmark csma-3-4-depth3 --timeout 600 --output-root /results"

docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/results/logs/modified":/results \
  dtpaynt-dev \
  bash -lc "cd /opt/synthesis-modified && python3 experiments-dts.py \
    --benchmark csma-3-4-depth3 --timeout 600 --output-root /results"
```

## 6\. Benchmarks to Showcase Strengths, Weaknesses, and Parity

Run the following docker one-liners to capture representative scenarios for the report. All artefacts land in `results/logs/<algorithm>` and can be compared with `process_results.py`.

**Strength (modified clearly faster)** — `maze` MDP with many shallow improvements:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/results/logs/original":/results \
  dtpaynt-original \
  bash -lc "cd /opt/synthesis-original && python3 experiments-dts.py \
    --benchmark models/mdp/maze --timeout 600 --output-root /results"

docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/results/logs/modified":/results \
  dtpaynt-dev \
  bash -lc "cd /opt/synthesis-modified && python3 experiments-dts.py \
    --benchmark models/mdp/maze --timeout 600 --output-root /results"
```

**Weakness (stack search still wins)** — preset `csma-3-4-depth3` often favours the original heuristic due to the fixed depth target. Use the commands in Section 5 to gather both runs.

**Parity (nearly identical)** — `consensus-4-2` converges to the same policy and value with very minor timing differences. It is already part of the default preset in Section 5.

After collecting the runs, generate the comparison table and plots:

```bash
python process_results.py --logs-root results/logs --output-dir results/analysis
```

The script automatically picks up the latest run per benchmark for each algorithm.
It also writes richer plots under `results/analysis/figures/`, including `frontier_size_vs_time.png`
and `families_evaluated_vs_time.png`, so the queue dynamics are visible instead of flat tree lines.

## 7\. Running Priority Search Comparison Tests

To verify and compare the performance of the original stack-based search against the new priority-queue-based search, we provide automated tests.

### Quick Test (Recommended)

Simply run the provided test script:

```bash
./run_tests_docker.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build a Docker image with both synthesis versions
2. Run comprehensive comparison tests
3. Display side-by-side performance metrics

### Manual Docker Test

If you prefer to run tests manually:

```bash
# Build the test image
docker build -t dtpaynt-better-value --build-arg SRC_FOLDER=synthesis-modified .

# Run the comparison tests
docker run --rm dtpaynt-better-value \
    bash -c "cd /opt/synthesis-modified && python tests/test_priority_search_comparison_docker.py"
```

### Local Test (Without Docker)

If you have PAYNT installed locally:

```bash
cd synthesis-modified
pytest tests/test_priority_search_comparison.py -v -s
```

### Test Output

The tests will show:
- Iteration-by-iteration priority queue processing logs
- Performance comparison tables (Time, Value, Tree Size, Iterations)
- Verification that modified algorithm ≥ original algorithm in solution quality

Example output:
```
================================================================================
COMPARISON RESULTS: Simple MDP

Modified (Priority-Q)          0.0987          9.8765          12              38             

Time improvement: +20.00%
Value improvement: +0.00%
```

## 8\. Accessing Results and Debugging

- **Results**: Consolidated under `results/` as described in Section 3. Aggregated CSVs (`run_summary.csv`, `comparison_latest.csv`) and plots live in `results/analysis`.

- **Interactive Shell**: If you need to debug or explore a container's file system, use the appropriate image name:

Bash

### To explore the modified version's container
```bash
docker run -it dtpaynt-dev bash
```
Once inside, you can navigate the file system using standard Linux commands. Type `exit` to leave the container.
